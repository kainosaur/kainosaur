- Hello! My name is Kain!
- I am majoring in Computer Science (started 2024) and I want to make as many friends as possible before graduating! (take that social anxiety!)
- My interests vary a lot, but right now I have a strong interest in Rust and Game Developement!
- I have recently been enjoying participating in Game Jams, and collaborating with many different people 😁
- I also like learning languages, and I am currently learning Spanish!
